DroidJoy Server!
===================

<p>With the DroidJoy Server you can fully emulate up to 4 physically attached gamepads.</br>
You can decide if you want to emulate a DInput or a XInput device.</p>

> **Note:**
> - In order to control the DroidJoy Server you have to download the DroidJoy [full](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grill.droidjoy) or [lite](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grill.droidjoy_demo) version.
> - The DroidJoy server requires Windows Vista or above.
> - If you are using Windows 7 or an older version, you have to download and install the official [XBox 360 Controller driver](https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-gb/d/xbox-360-controller-for-windows) to emulate XInput devices.

#### Troubleshooting

* Be sure the DroidJoy Server is not blocked by any Antivirus program or Firewall.
* Be sure that your PC and your Smartphone are registered in the same network.
* If you want to use Bluetooth to establish a connection be sure your PC is set to discoverable.
* Be sure the DroidJoy Server and the DroidJoy App are using the same connection ports (default behaviour).
